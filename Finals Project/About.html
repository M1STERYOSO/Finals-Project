                <p>Hi! I am Billie Palmer C. Eason a first year at FEU TECH! <br>
                My course is Bachelor of Science in Information Technology with Specialization in Animation and Game Development. I'm 20 years old and my hobbies are mostly just singing and playing.<br>
                My coding journey has a lot of ups and A TON of downs. First sem was kind to me and I thought I was really good at programming, second sem was mean and showed that I was not as good as I thought, then third sem where I've come to accept that I'm not as good as I thought and now I'm striving to be better.
